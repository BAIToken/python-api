# BAI Project Blockchain API

This repository contains the Python API for interacting with the BAI project's contracts on the supported blockchains. It provides a convenient way to solve tasks using the blockchain and waits for the task's solutions.

## Installation

Before using this API, ensure you have Python installed on your system.  To set up the API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.
3. Install the necessary node modules by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Configuration

To configure the API, create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory with the following contents:

```env
type = 'Waves'
seed = '<Your_Seed>'
contractAddress = '<Contract Address>'
nodeURL = '<node Url>'
network = '<main or testnet>'
assetId = '<asset id>'
```

for using the Waves network. In case of an EVM based network, the corresponding .env file should look like the following example:

```env
type = 'evm'
contractAddress = '<the address of the main BAI contract>'
privateKey = '<your private key>'
endpoint = '<your endpoint, e.g., from alchemy, ...>'
tokenAddress = '<the contract address of the ERC20 BAI token on the network>'
chainId = '<your ChainId>'
```

Replace the corresponding parameters with your actual settings to interact with the blockchain.

## Usage
Here's a quick example to use the API to solve a task:

```Python
from BAIAPI import BAIAPI

apiInstance = BAIAPI()

try:
    solution = apiInstance.solveTask('Create a picture of Kurt Gödel', 'dalle')
    print('Solution: ', solution)
except:
    print('Error: ', Exception)
```

This script initializes the API, sends a task to the blockchain, and logs the solution once it's ready.

## API Reference

### `solveTask(task, taskType)`

Sends a task to the blockchain for solving and returns the solution.

- `task`: The task description or objective.
- `taskType`: The type of task to register on the blockchain.

## Modules

### `BAIAPI.py`

This is the main API module that abstracts the `WavesConnection` to interact with the Waves blockchain.

### `wavesConnection.py`

Handles direct interactions with the Waves blockchain, such as sending tasks, retrieving task prices, and waiting for task solutions.
